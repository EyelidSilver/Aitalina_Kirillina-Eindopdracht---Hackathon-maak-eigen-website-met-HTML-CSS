                            Icelandic population. This colourful and quirky city is packed with numerous restaurants,

                        <p>Save the best for last? Iceland is known as one of the youngest landmasses on the planet and
                            was one of the last places
                            on earth to be settled by humans. Surprisingly, over 1,100 years ago Vikings from Norway
                            discovered Iceland by accident.

                        <p>Iceland went through a prohibition of beer which began in 1915 and ended in 1989 after a

                            population. Now, every March 1st, the country celebrates ‚ÄúBj√≥rdagurinn‚Äù or ‚ÄúBeer Day‚Äù
                            commemorating the end of a 74-year
